# RustyPlayer: An audio player built with Rust
RustyPlayer is an audio player built in pure Rust using egui for the GUI (https://crates.io/crates/egui) and rodio (https://crates.io/crates/rodio) for audio playback. It uses Symphonia (https://crates.io/crates/symphonia/0.3.0) and id3 (https://crates.io/crates/id3) to extract audio metadata like album title, artist name, and album artwork.
